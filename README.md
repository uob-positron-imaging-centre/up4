# pyAnalyser

A fast flexible analysing toolset for particle data of all kinds.

Use it to compare interplatform particle results - either experimental
or synthetic data generated by different platforms like LIGGGHTS, MercuryDPM, 
Barracuda and more. 

pyAnalyser has a python surface, which enables it to be easy to use for a wide range of 
scientists, but the core of it is implemented in RUST.
