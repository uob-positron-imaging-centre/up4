# uPPPP

A fast flexible analysing toolset for particle data of all kinds.

Use it to compare interplatform particle results - either experimental
or synthetic data generated by different platforms like LIGGGHTS, MercuryDPM, 
Barracuda and more. 

pyAnalyser has a python surface, which enables it to be easy to use for a wide range of 
scientists, but the core of it is implemented in RUST. 


## Installation

Download or clone this repository and run:

    python3 -m pip install .

this could take some time as it compiles the rust code on your machine. 

### Dependencies

Python librarys:
  - plotly
  - h5py
  - numpy
  - vtk 
  - natsort 
  - tqdm
  - pandas >= 1.3

you will need a rust compiler, see:

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Rust dependencys will be installed automatically before compilation



### ToDo
Still no conversion from any simulation tool to HDF5
