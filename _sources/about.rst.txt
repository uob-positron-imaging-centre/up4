The `up4` package is `GPL v3.0
<https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/>`_ licensed. In non-lawyer terms, the key points of this license are:

- You can view, use, copy and modify this code **_freely_**.
- Your modifications must _also_ be licensed with GPL v3.0 or later.
- If you share your modifications with someone, you have to include the source code as well.

Essentially, do whatever you want with the code, but don't try selling it saying it's yours :). GPL v3.0 is indeed a very strong *copyleft* license; it was deliberately chosen to maintain the openness and transparency of great software and progress. This also ties into the very reason for `up4`'s conception - to transparently process and compare Lagrangian data, regardless of source. Further, open collaboration is frankly way more efficient than closed, for-profit competition.
