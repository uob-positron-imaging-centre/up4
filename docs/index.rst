=======================================================================
Universal Post Processor for Particulate Processes  - The Documentation
=======================================================================
Has this ever happened to you:

* You have obtained a *bucketload* of particle data from a Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation, or perhaps you have data from Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) that you wish to graph. 

* You have spent a non-trivial amount of time generating post-processing code to analyse this data, wishing that there was a toolset that could do this for you and save time?

Fear not, this is *precisely* the aim of UPPPP, the Universal Post Processor for Particulate Processes!
