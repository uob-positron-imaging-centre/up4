API Reference
*************

From here on out, UPPPP will be referred to its Python package name, ``up4``, for brevity. All public ``up4`` members are documented here alongside some examples that can be copied and pasted. You can also use the `Search` bar to directly find what you need.

We really want to make this library simplify the analysis of particle data in a quick, reproducible, transparent and easy to use manner; if you feel that something can be improved/ added, or care to share examples/ showcases, *please* feel free to get in contact with any of us!

These docs cover the Python API, but the Rust source code is located `here`_.
